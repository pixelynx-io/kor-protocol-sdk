# KOR Protocol SDK

The KOR SDK (Software Development Kit) is a toolkit designed to facilitate the development of applications that involve Intellectual Property Rights on blockchain.

The KOR SDK offers a suite of easy-to-use functions for uploading assets, minting NFTs, and managing intellectual property (IP) rights on the blockchain. It provides smooth integration with KORâ€™s infrastructure for handling IP assets and supports various JavaScript frameworks, streamlining development, testing, and deployment across different environments.

## Prerequisites

To follow this tutorial, ensure you have Node version 20 or later and npm version 8 or higher installed in your environment. You can download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version from the Node.js official website.

### Create a React/Next Project

First, create a react project using the below guide:

https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project

### Install the Dependencies

While in the kor-ts-example folder, install the Kor Protocol SDK node package,

You can use any of the following package managers to install the dependencies:

`npm install --save @kor_protocol/core-sdk`

or

`yarn add @kor_protocol/core-sdk`

or

`pnpm add @kor_protocol/core-sdk`

### SDK Initialization

To initialize the SDK, you need to provide your API key and the RPC URL of the blockchain network.

```React
import { initKorSDK } from '@kor_protocol/core-sdk';
const apiKey = 'your-api-key';
const rpcUrl = 'https://your-rpc-url';
const origin  = 'sandbox-origin-url'
const korSDK = initKorSDK(apiKey, {rpcUrl, chain, origin});
```

- API Key: Your unique identifier used to authenticate requests to the KOR Protocol backend. To obtain an API key, please reach out to the admin.
- RPC URL: This is the URL of the blockchain network you are connecting to. It could be the URL of a public or private Ethereum node.
- Chain: This is the id of the chain on which operations should be performed.
- Origin: Initializes the module in a sandbox/production environment. For sandbox environment use https://dq9c2zl6kih9v.cloudfront.net/kor-sdk-api
